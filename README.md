# PEGPUL: Perceptron ensemble of graph-based positive-unlabeled learning
PEGPUL is method for identifying disease genes using Positive Unlabeled learning schema.

We proposed a PEGPUL method for identifying disease genes using machine learning tools. The method uses three biological attributes and a positive unlabeled co-learning schema to extract a reliable set of positive and negative genes. The similarity graph of genes is built using metric learning, and a Perceptron ensemble is learned from three weighted classifiers used to classify on ~12000 samples. The project highlights the importance of using machine learning tools for identifying disease genes and demonstrates the potential semi-supervised learning algorithm on a large dataset of disease genes.
